# OpenGL Sky

This is a 100% procedural sky + clouds renderer. It calculates everything inside a shader.

I can run it without glitches in a cheap 2011 Macbook Air.

### What does it look like?

Here's a sample with default settings:

### What is it

There are two things here.

#### Blue sky

This thing uses a Mie + Rayleigh scattering function for the sky. Well, almost, it is too heavy so I fitted it to a makeshift math function until it was fast enough.

Here's the mu:

```c
float mu = dot(normalize(pos), normalize(fsun));
```

Here's the extinction. I don't remember how I came up with that. Sorry! :(

```c
vec3 extinction = mix(exp(-exp(-((pos.y + fsun.y * 4.0) * (exp(-pos.y * 16.0) + 0.1) / 80.0) / Br) * (exp(-pos.y * 16.0) + 0.1) * Kr / Br) * exp(-pos.y * exp(-pos.y * 8.0 ) * 4.0) * exp(-pos.y * 2.0) * 4.0, vec3(1.0 - exp(fsun.y)) * 0.2, -fsun.y * 0.2 + 0.5);
```

And here's Rayleigh:

```
3.0 / (8.0 * 3.14) * (1.0 + mu * mu)
```

Mie:

```
(Kr + Km * (1.0 - g * g) / (2.0 + g * g) / pow(1.0 + g * g - 2.0 * g * mu, 1.5)) / (Br + Bm)
```

That's it. Multiply those two with the extinction and you have your sky.

#### Clouds

The clouds use multi-layer brownian noise.

I have a main cloud layer that simulates Cumulus (fluffy) clouds, but it doesn't look that great. You need at least 10 layers of noise for it to look a bit fluffy. I'm using 4, I think. The more you use, the slower it is.

There's also a less dense, cloud layer that simulates Cirrus (icy) clouds. This one looks OK and requires a single layer.

### Compiling

 - Install `glfw3` (`brew install glfw3` if you're on a Mac).
 - Edit `Makefile` and change the path to `glfw/includes` and `glfw/lib/libglfw3.a` (you can use `libglfw.dylib` here if you don't have `libglfw3.a`).
 - Run `make`. It should work.
 
I didn't put a lot of time into it, so 

### Where are the settings?

They're scattered around the code.

Sorry. Ha!

#### Cirrus Fluffiness ‚òÅÔ∏è

The `3` below is the amount of cirrus layers you'll render. The more you use, the slower it is üòû

```c
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
```

#### Amount of clouds üå•

The bigger the number the more there are. From zero to one, I think. Play around with it.

```
uniform float cirrus = 0.9;
uniform float cumulus = 0.2;
```

#### Speed ‚ö°Ô∏è

The `0.2f` below is the speed ratio. Crank it to `5.0f` if you're in a hurry to see the full cycle!

```c
renderEntity(s.entities[i], p, v, (float)glfwGetTime() * 0.2f - 0.0f);
```

#### Nitrogen Color üèû

That's not exactly the color of nitrogen, but let's pretend it is!

```c
const vec3 nitrogen = vec3(0.650, 0.570, 0.475);
```

#### Scattering Coefficients ü§ì

Play around with those. I got them emphirically, so I can't really explain why they are that amount ü§®

```c
const float Br = 0.0025; // Rayleigh coefficient
const float Bm = 0.0003; // Mie coefficient
const float g =  0.9800; // Mie scattering direction. Should be ALMOST 1.0f
```

Another favourite setting of mine. I think it looks better.

```
const float Br = 0.0020;
const float Bm = 0.0009;
const float g =  0.9200;
```

And another. Softer.

```c
const float Br = 0.0010;
const float Bm = 0.0003;
const float g =  0.9200;
```

Please ask me about it and I'll license it to you :)
